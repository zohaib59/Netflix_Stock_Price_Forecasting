# ðŸ“ˆ Netflix Stock Price Forecasting with Prophet.
Just wrapped up an exciting time series analysis project where I explored log transformation, seasonality, holiday effects, 
and lag features for improved accuracy. Prophet's flexibility and interpretability made it a powerful tool to dive deep into Netflix's price patterns!

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using Meta's **Prophet** model applied to Netflix's historical stock data. 
It includes log transformations, seasonality modeling, Indian holidays integration, and lag-based regressors to improve forecasting accuracy.
